_based on the Sorting Hat concept from the Harry Potter books/films_

#### Exercise Requirements

  - A button in the Jumbotron should open a Bootstrap form, which provides an input field for student name and a Submit button
  - Upon Submit, the student's card should display their name and randomly selected House, and clear the input field
  - Each card should also contain an Expel button, which removes them from the record of students
  - App should be responsive to multiple device screen sizes (particularly small screens)

#### Bonus Challenges Completed
  - [x] Error message appears for attempted submission of blank name
  - [x] Color of the student card varies, depending upon House
  - [x] Sort the student cards by some criteria, such as alphabetized names
  - [x] Display the expelled students as a separate set of cards, and style them differently from the others
